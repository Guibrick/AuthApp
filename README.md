# eCommerce Backend

This lab will take at least three weeks to finish. It's meant to learn about authorization, authentication, tokens, password-hashing, logging and more. We will provide you with a frontend that you are expected to make changes to. You are welcome to create your own frontend, but we recommend that you focus on the backend. 

Expectations:

The goal and expectation for this lab is that you will be able to set-up your own backend with authorization and authentication. You should understand the set-up for password-hashing. Solutions like auth0 or Firebase, are not to be used this time. The most important part is that you learn and have something to show at the end.

Assignment:

We recommend that you set aside time in the beginning to properly plan out this project. This is an eCommerce app (reminiscent of Amazon) that allows stores to create their own company sites and put up their own products. A regular customer should be able to view all the products from each of the stores. Store admins should be able to upload new products.

App Requirements:

* The app should be able to display products with a filter bar and search.
* Each product should have its own page with the ability to add products to a cart.
* The cart should persist in local storage and only be visible if the user is logged in. 
* The backend should log each request from the clients in a document.
* Authentication should be present in both the frontend and backend.
* The app should have three different roles: Super Admin, Store Admin, and User.

Page Requirements:

* Login & Sign-up page
* Home page
* User page
* Store Admin page
* Super Admin page
* Profile page

Database and Frontend:

The database is provided and ready to use. The frontend is a starting point and needs more work. You are welcome to update it or create your own.
